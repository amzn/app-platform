## [0.0.2] - 2025-05-02

### Changed

- **Breaking change:** Changed the constructor from `ComposeAndroidRendererFactory` to two factory functions instead. A new API allows you to use this factory without an Android View as parent, see #39.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the `onEvent` function used in `MoleculePresenters`. This is no longer needed since Kotlin 2.0.20, see #21.

### Fixed

- Made the `ModuleStructureDependencyCheckTask` cacheable, see #19.
- Fixed violations for Gradle's project isolation feature, see #20.

### Other Notes

- Updated the sample application with a shared transition animation to highlight how animations can be implemented for `Template` updates, see #37.


## [0.0.1] - 2025-04-17

- Initial release.
