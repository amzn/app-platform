The App Platform is a lightweight application framework for state and memory management suitable
for Kotlin Multiplatform projects, in particular Android, iOS, JVM, native and Web. It makes the
dependency inversion and dependency injection (DI) design patterns first class principles to develop

which allows different application targets to change the look and feel.
