# Blueprints

This folder contains reusable templates ("blueprints") to help you quickly get started with projects using [App Platform](https://github.com/amzn/app-platform).

## 📁 `starter/`

The `starter/` blueprint provides everything you need to bootstrap a new project with App Platform. It includes:

- Pre-configured `build.gradle.kts` files for Kotlin Multiplatform
- Android + iOS + WASM targets with Compose UI enabled
- App Platform integrations like Molecule presenters and Kotlin Inject
- A working module structure with navigation and templates

> 💡 More blueprints may be added in the future to support different project styles or configurations.
