/**
 * An implementation of [Renderer] that is specific to Android View based UI. This renderer provides
 * some built in convenience for rendering Android Views such as managing your child's UI in
 * relation to the provided parent's lifecycle.
 *
 * Your custom renderers should extend this abstract class and provide implementations for [inflate]
 * and [renderModel].
 *
 * [inflate] is where one time view set up should take place. This method will not be called again
 * while the Renderer is in use. This method is roughly equivalent to `onCreateView` and should be
 * used inflate layouts or write UI code directly in Kotlin.
 *
 * ```
 *  private lateinit var myView: TextView
 *
 *  override fun inflate(
 *      activity: Activity,
 *      parent: ViewGroup,
 *      layoutInflater: LayoutInflater
 *  ): View {
 *      return layoutInflator.inflate(R.layout.myView, parent, false).also {
 *          // Here you can initialize other variables you need to use in your [renderModel] method.
 *          myView = it.findViewById(R.id.myView)
 *      }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * [renderModel] is called each time there is a new model for this renderer to render. Place logic
 * here that is specific to binding model data or callbacks to your view layer.
 *
 * ```
 * override fun renderModel(model: MyModel) {
 *     myView.text = model.text
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Optionally your custom renderer can override [onDetach] to perform cleanup tasks before your
 * views are removed from the hierarchy. Once the inflated view was detached from the window, it
 * will be removed from the parent and nullified. If this [ViewRenderer] is reused, then a new view
 * will be inflated and added to the parent.
