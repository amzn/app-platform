/**
 * An implementation of [Renderer] that is specific to Android View based UI and uses Android ViewBinding. This renderer
 * provides some built in convenience for rendering Android Views such as managing your child's UI in relation to the
 * provided parent's lifecycle and inflating ViewBindings.
 *
 * Your custom renderers should extend this abstract class and provide implementations for [inflateViewBinding] and
 * [renderModel].
 *
 * [inflateViewBinding] is where one time ViewBinding inflation should take place. This method will not be called again
 * while the Renderer is in use. This method is roughly equivalent to `onCreateView`.
 *
 * ```
 *  override fun inflateViewBinding(
 *      activity: Activity,
 *      parent: ViewGroup,
 *      layoutInflater: LayoutInflater
 *  ): MyLayoutBinding = MyLayoutBinding.inflate(layoutInflater, parent, false)
 * ```
 *
 * [renderModel] is called each time there is a new model for this renderer to render. Place logic here that is specific
 * to binding model data or callbacks to your view layer.
 *
 * ```
 * override fun renderModel(model: MyModel) {
 *     binding.myTextView.text = model.text
 * }
 * ```
