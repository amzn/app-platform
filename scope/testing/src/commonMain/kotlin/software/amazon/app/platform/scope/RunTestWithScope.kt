 * following
 *
 * ```
 * @Test
 * fun `test lifecycle`() = runTestWithScope { scope ->
 *    val myScoped = MyScoped()
 *
 *    // This calls myScoped.onEnterScope() for you.
 *    scope.register(myScoped)
 *
 *    ...
 *    // myScoped.onExitScope() will be called for you.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Similar to [Scope.Companion.buildTestScope], this function will use [StandardTestDispatcher] by
 * default, but this can be overridden using [context] parameter:
 * ```
 * runTestWithScope(UnconfinedTestDispatcher()) { ... }
