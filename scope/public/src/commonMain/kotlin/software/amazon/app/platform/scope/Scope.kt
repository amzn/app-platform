/**
 * Scopes define the boundary our software components operate in. A scope is a space with a well-defined lifecycle that
 * can be created and torn down. Scopes host other service objects and serve as container for them, e.g. DI components.
 * To receive a callback when a scope is created or destroyed the [Scoped] interface can be used.
 *
 * Scopes can have 0-N children. Child scopes have the same or a shorter lifecycle as their parent scope. If the parent
 * scope gets destroyed, then all child scopes are destroyed as well.
 *
 * After a scope has been destroyed it should no longer be used. All methods will throw an exception instead.
